Hi! my name is Zirxy I am creating this because a lot of people want to either rank up or get out of silver.
Let me just say this, I am not 100% guaranteed this will work for everyone but my friend and I have tested this out and it worked for 
bot of us.
This is called the "Vinnie Paz ranking system" because my friend Vinnie discovered how fast you can rank up in csgo by using this
method. I will also describe every step at the end.
Now follow these steps very carefully!
1) Get a 4 people that are higher ranks then you. Example Silver 3 with gold novas
2) Play only 2 maximum matches a day.
3) (optional) Play deathmatch when you reach the limit of matches a day or if your waiting for friends.
4) (optional) Do only one solo queue a day.
5)
